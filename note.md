Process of Connection:

Peer: 
1. Create Socket with Server
2. Establish communication channel (input and output stream)
3. send an authenticated message (class message -> authenticateMessage) using a secret.
4. send an actual request from class message.

Server:
1. While loop keep listening
2. if there's a connection from a socket, establish connection by
3. calling a process socket (request) method
4. after finish processing, close connection.
5. keep listening, go back to step 1.


### Code:

- `runServer.sh` : use `./runServer.sh` to run this script, clear maven package and reintall maven dependencies and 
- recompile code to run server program.
- `runClient.sh` : use `./runClient.sh` to run this script, clear maven package and reintall maven dependencies and 
- recompile code to run client program.
- `runBoth.sh` : use `./runBoth.sh` to run this script, clear maven package and reintall maven dependencies and 
- recompile code, run server and client in separate terminal windows on the same machine.

### Run Code:

#### Same Machine:
use `./runBoth.sh` to run server and client on same machine, by default:
- Server Address: localhost
- Server Port: 3200

#### Different Machine in a local network (IP address begin with 192.xxx.xxx):

- Server Machine: use `./runServer.sh` to run server, by default:
  - Server Address: localhost (use `hostname -I` in terminal to get current local IP address).
  - Server Port: 3200

- Client Machine: use `./runClient.sh` to run Client, *Need to Update Settings*:
  1. Open `Config` by pressing `C`,
  2. Update Index Server Address: enter Server Machine's local IP address retrieved from previous step.
  3. Update Port from previous step (by default 3200).
  4. Done!
